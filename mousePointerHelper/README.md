#Application Usage Doc

##What's this app?
 
 This is an application for user who wanna have another mouse cursor with offsets on your screen.
 
 Since i am using windows 10 insider preview (cur:b10122 pro) on my laptop, i found that every applications which work with  OpenGL will have a dislocation display. althourgh i know M$ will solve the problem in a upcoming update of win10, i still decided to write a mini-application for self usage.

##How to use this app?

 Just double click and it will run.
 
 emm.. still some guide for not-me-users.
 
 1. you should change the offset first to MAKE SURE your real cursor CANNOT click on the virtual cursor.
 2. make sure you did #1
 3. make sure you did #1
 4. make sure you did #1
 5. make sure you did #1
 6. ...

##Can i get the source code?

 So.. where are you? lol
 
 to build this application, you should have Qt 5.3.1 or a newer version of Qt.
 You can use the source code to do anything since i use [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) for this app(<b>not</b> include the cursor icon). Of course, if you credit me, i will be happy.
 
##Update?

 Yeah it actually have two new release version of this mini-app. they are:
 
 1. v1.0-release: added icon for exec-file.
 2. v1.1-release: allowed offset lower than 0, allowed setting canvas size.

##Other info?

 the Cursor icon is from the game [Ori and the blind forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ori_and_the_Blind_Forest) screenshot and 61 use photoshop removed the background. so it actually not directly extracted from the game <b>Ori</b> (is that so?). that game is an awesome <b>Metroidvania</b> <b>Platform adventure</b> game. try it if you love this kind of game.
 
 I use Qt 5.3.1 and QtCreator 3.2.0. QtC3.2.0 can works more cool than the older version of QtC.
 
 The real cursor will not click on the app form if the widget or any-postiton's opacity is smaller than 3. that's how this app work.
 
 And... Maybe you should use google translate or any other stuff to translate the comments in the source code.
