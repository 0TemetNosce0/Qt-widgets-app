   This software based on the Qt 4.8.x libraries.
   
   INSTALL on Linux based systems (Win32 see later in this document)
   ---- You can run this package parallel to other versions of 2Pnotes. ----

   This Software is distributed without a makefile. The easiest way to compile 
   the sources is the use of the qtcreator. The qtcreator is a component
   of "Qt Software" and comes with your qt package. If not, download it from
   the qt homepage http://qt.digia.com.
      
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	If you use a 32 bit operating system edit the headerfiles md5hash.h and blowfish.h first.
	Comment out the term #define X86_64 and save the files.
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   After compiling copy the binary 2Pnotes in a folder of your choice. I
   prefer /usr/local/bin. If you need the german language, copy the file 
   2Pnotes-2.0.5_de.qm from the language folder into the same folder
   like the 2Pnotes binary. 

   Now you are ready to use 2Pnotes.
   
   Please report bugs to me.

   1. Install MinGW (look at mingw.org) and the Ot 4.x for Windows C++
   (look at qtsoftware.com/downloads/) on your system.
   
   2. Copy the 2Pnotes packet into a folder of your choice.
   
   3. Change into the subfolder 2Pnotes-2.0.5.

   the term #define X86_64 and save the files.
   
   5. Use the qtcreator to compile the sources (see above).
   
   6. If you like to put the executable into an other folder and you
   like to use it with german language, copy the file 2Pnotes-2.0.5_de.qm
   together with the executable into the same folder.
